These are the installation instructions for the Manticore compiler and
runtime system.  This document is organized into three sections: the
first lists the requirements for building the system and running
Manticore programs; the second give installation instructions for the
distribution; and the third gives installation instructions for
building from the svn repository.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIREMENTS
------------

Manticore currently only supports the x86-64 (a.k.a. AMD64)
architecture running the Linux operating system.  It is possible to
build the compiler on other systems (see below), but we have not
ported the runtime or code generator to them yet.

Manticore is implemented in a mix of C and SML code.  You will need a
recent version of SML/NJ (version 110.64+) installed.  Furthermore,
your installation should include the MLRISC library.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUILDING AND INSTALLING THE DISTRIBUTION
----------------------------------------


------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUILDING FROM SVN
-----------------

Building and installing the system from svn sources follows the same
steps as above, but you first must initialize the configuration
script.  To do so, run the following two commands:

	autoheader -Iconfig
	autoconf -Iconfig

Then proceed with the installation instructions from the previous
section.
