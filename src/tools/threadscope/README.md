Provides support for STM events

You must also install the stm branch of the ghc-events repository, which
can be found [here](https://github.com/ml9951/ghc-events).

Note that if you are building on Mac OS X, you will need to install
gtk with the -fhave-quartz-gtk flag

    cabal install gtk -fhave-quartz-gtk
