This directory contains Manticore programs and some scripts for benchmarking.

- benchmark.bsh: get timing results for a Manticore program given different numbers of processors and input
sizes.

  For example, the command below benchmarks rt-parr.pml for 128 and 256 pixes in sequential mode and in
  parallel mode on 1 and 2 processors.  The -q option is optional and causes the benchmark script to
  use its argument to compile the sequential mode benchmark.

    benchmark.bsh -e rt-parr -q rt -p 0 -p 1 -p 2 -s 128 -s 256
