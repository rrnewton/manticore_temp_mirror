This directory contains Manticore programs and some scripts for benchmarking.  Below is a list of the scripts you can use.

- benchmark.bsh: get timing results for a Manticore program given different numbers of processors and input sizes.

E.g. benchmarking the rt-parr.pml for sizes 128 and 256 and for sequential execution and parallel execution on 1 and 2 processors (the -s specifies an optional sequential counterpart).

  benchmark.bsh -e rt-parr -s rt-parr-seq -p 0 -p 1 -p 2 -s 128 -s 256
