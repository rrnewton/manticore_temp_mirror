This directory contains programs that are used to generate offsets into the
various runtime data structures.  The programs are

	gen-asm-offsets
		generates offsets that are used by the runtime-system
		assembly code

	gen-runtime-constants
		generates offsets that are used in the basis HLOps

	gen-runtime-offsets
		generates offsets that are used by the compiler

To guarantee that a consistent view of the offsets is used by compiler,
runtime, and basis library, we compute a CRC32 fingerprint of the
constants (see crc.[ch]).  The fingerprint is computed over the following
symbols in the following order (the order is important!!):

	the VProc offsets defined in vproc-offsets-ins.c

	offset of LogBuffer_t::next
	offset of LogBuffer_t::log

	offset of LogEvent_t::event
	offset of LogEvent_t::data
