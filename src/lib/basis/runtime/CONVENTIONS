Below are some conventions for programming the runtime basis library.

Signal mask
Some HLOps rely on the signal mask being in a certain state (a for atomic or 
n for non-atomic). We use the following naming convention for these hlops.

  @*from-atomic : a -> n             (atomic flag is set before the call)
  @*to-atomic   : n -> a             (atomic flag is set after the call)
  @*in-atomic   : a -> a             (atomic flag is set before and after the call)
