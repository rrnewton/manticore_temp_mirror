Below are some conventions for programming the runtime basis library.

Signal mask
If a HLop has pre or post conditions regarding the signal mask, the function name should reflect
the condition.

 - *from-atomic Signals must be masked before the call.
 - *to-atomic Signals are masked upon returning.
 - *in-atomic Signals are masked before and after the call.
