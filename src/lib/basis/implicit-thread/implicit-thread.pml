  (* Work groups
   * 
   * Work groups are collections of workers that execute implicit threads. Differet work groups may employ different 
   * scheduling policies to determine the order in which to execute threads. This module does not define a particular
   * scheduling policy, but rather provides a uniform interface between client code and scheduling code.

    type work_group

  (* Scoping rules and the work group stack
   *
   * We use a dynamic scoping discipline for work groups. At any instant, exactly one work group is in scope, which
   * we call the current work group. The current work group serves as the target for our implicitly-threaded
   * scheduling operations. For instance, the call to ImplicitThread.@spawn(thd) enqueues the given thread on
   * the current work group. 
   *
   * Client code may assign the current work group temporarily by using runOnWorkGroup. This operation enforces 
   * our dynamic scoping rule by restoring the previous worker once the given thunk has returned its value. We 
   * implement this behaviour by dynamically maintaining a stack of work work group references. We also provide
   * an operation called defaultWorkGroupBegin, which initializes the work-group stack. We use this operation
   * in the spawn operation for CML threads.
