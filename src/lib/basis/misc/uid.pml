 * UIDs are globally-unique identifiers available to Manticore applications. We avoid 
 * any synchronization overhead by setting the leftmost lg_2(P) bits to the processor
 * id, where P is the number of processors. For example, the first uid to be created
 * by processor 3 would be 3 * 2^(64 - lg_2(P)). Each processor has 64 - lg_2(P) bits
 * for uids.
