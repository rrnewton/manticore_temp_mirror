 *
 * This file describes the various events that can be logged by the Manticore system.  The
 * file is split into two logical parts.  The first part defines the version of the file
 * and the second defines the events and their formats.
 *
 * The file is a single JSON object with four fields:
 *
 *	date	-- a string representing the YYYYMMDD date as a hexadecimal literal.
 *
 *	version	-- an array of three integers representing the major, minor, and patch-level
 *		   version numbers of the file.  The version numbers should be increased as
 *		   follows:
 *			-- increase the patch number when changing the description of an event or
 *			   argument, or changing the group structure.
 *			-- increase the minor-version number when adding new events to the end of
 *			   the file.  Such changes should not effect existing logs with the same
 *			   major-version number.
 *			-- increase the major version number when changing the order of events,
 *			   or changing the order, number, or type of arguments of existing events.
 *
 *	events	-- an array of event descriptors.
 *
 * The fields of an event descriptor are
 *
 *	name	-- symbolic name
 *
 *	args	-- an array of argument descriptors.  Each log entry can have up to 20 bytes of
 *		   argument data, which starts at byte 12 of the event object.
 *			name	-- the argument's name
 *			ty	-- the type of the argument.  The types are:
 *					addr	-- 64-bit address or ML value
 *					int	-- 32-bit signed integer
 *					word	-- 32-bit unsigned integer
 *					float	-- 32-bit floating-point number
 *					double	-- 64-bit floating-point number
 *					new-id	-- a new 64-bit event identifier.  This will be
 *						   generated and returned by the logging code.
 *					id	-- 64-bit event identifier
 *					strN	-- N-character string (0 < N <= 20)
 *			loc	-- the offset of the field (in bytes) from the start of the event.
 *				   This field is required when the order of arguments does not
 *				   determine the layout.
 *			desc	-- English-language description of argument
 *
 *	attrs	-- an array of attributes, which are represented by strings.  This field is optional
 *		   and is assumed to be empty if not present.  The recognized attributes are:
 *			src	-- this event is the source of a dependent event and has a new-id
 *				   argument.
 *			pml	-- this event is only generated by PML/BOM code
 *			rt	-- this event is only generated by C code
 *
 *	desc	-- English-language description of event
